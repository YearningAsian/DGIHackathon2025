# 🏠 DGI Hackathon 2025 --- Rebuilding Together Nashville

**"Repairing Homes, Revitalizing Communities, Rebuilding Lives."**

## 📖 Overview

This project was developed for the **DGI Hackathon 2025** with a focus
on using **data-driven insights** to demonstrate how community housing
repair investments improve lives and strengthen neighborhoods.

Our team partnered with **Rebuilding Together Nashville**, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to preserving affordable housing and stabilizing
neighborhoods through critical home repairs.

We combined **census data**, **service application data**, and **housing
records** to analyze the measurable community impact of home repair
programs in Nashville---specifically in areas like **Dickerson Pike
(37207)** and **Greater Bordeaux (37218)**.

## 💡 The Challenge

Many nonprofits struggle to **quantify their social impact**. Our goal
was to design a **data-backed storytelling model** that proves how
housing repair initiatives: - Help fight **gentrification** by keeping
long-term residents in their homes\
- Promote **economic stability** and **generational wealth**\
- Preserve **social support networks** within historically marginalized
communities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Approach

We asked:\
\> *How can we use data to prove that home repair programs truly
strengthen communities?*

Our solution involved:\
- **Integrating multiple data sources** (census data, income
distribution, housing repair records)\
- **Identifying "quick-win" repairs** --- low-cost, high-impact projects
that maximize return on investment\
- **Visualizing impact per dollar** to show how each repair contributes
to community stability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Key Insights

-   **317+ individual repairs** completed since 2018\
-   **151 homes repaired** from 2019--2024\
-   Focused on **high-severity but low-cost repairs** to create
    meaningful change\
-   Demonstrated that **targeted housing investments** can lead to
    stronger, more resilient neighborhoods

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏘️ Community Context

Gentrification remains a critical issue in Nashville, disproportionately
affecting Black communities.\
Our analysis highlighted how **home-repair assistance programs** act as
a buffer against displacement --- maintaining affordability, stability,
and belonging.
